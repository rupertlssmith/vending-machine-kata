Modelling the On/Off state in software is a little weird. Presumably a real machine when off has no software running at all, therefore code cannot make checks such as not allowing coins to be inserted when the machine is off. For the purposes of this exercise I will assume that this is a pure software machine - perhaps it is a software module that can be deployed to vending machine hardware where the on/off state of the module is a different lifecycle to the on/off power state of the machine itself.
